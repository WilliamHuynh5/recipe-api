1. All units of measurement that are countable, for example "1 egg", "1 slice of bread" are not convertible.
       
2. Unit of measurement conversions will be made to 2dp.

3. Portions are not limited to whole numbers. For example, 1.5 portions is a valid portion size.

4. Mass and Volume cross-conversions should not occur. For example, if a user requests to convert 100g of chicken (mass) to "ml" (volume), the conversion should not happen.
    -> Technically this can still be supported, but it doesn't make a lot of sense. i.e. 1KG of Chicken != 1 Liter of Chicken (at least in the context of recipes)
